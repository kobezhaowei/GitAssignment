(a) 3

(b) Using command "git log", I got a commit logs history. The modified date:
Thu Sep 15 10:29:34  2016

A .gitignore file should be committed into your repository, in order to share
the ignore rules with any other users that clone the repository.


(c)  Here is the times each files inside the src folder got modified.
     
     BasicWeapon.java: 1
     RoleGame.java: 1
     Sword.java: 2
     Weapon.java: 1
     WeaponFactory.java: 1

(d) git log: Shows the commit logs. The command takes options applicable to the git 
rev-list command to control what is shown and how, and options applicable to the git
diff-* commands to control how the changes each commit introduces are shown. We can
use git log to view the commit history.

git status: Show the working tree status
Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the current HEAD commit,
paths that have differences between the working tree and the index file, and paths in
the working tree that are not tracked by Git (and are not ignored by gitignore). The 
first are what you would commit by running git commit; the second and third are what
you could commit by running git add before running git commit.

So "git log" shows the history of all commits to the repository, "git status" shows the
current status of the repository.

(e) git log -- RoleGame.java or gitk RoleGame.java

(f) git log --grep=file

(g) git log  --author="Alice" --since "09 1 2016" --until "09 16 2016"
